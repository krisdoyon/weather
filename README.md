# Overview

I built this small project with the intention of practicing comsuing and displaying API data, specifically integrating data from multiple sources and using redux toolkit for handling and dispatching async actions. I originally built this app using vanilla JS and recently converted it to a React application which was a valuable experience as I got some practice in reviewing, refactoring and optimizing an existing codebase.

# Things Learned

- Using promise.all for handling multiple API calls.
- Using async/await and error handling using try/catch.
- Using the Axios HTTP library to fetch API data.
- First time using Redux Toolkit's createAsyncThunk in an independent project.

# Technologies used

- React
- Redux Toolkit
- SCSS modules

#### APIs / Libraries:

- OpenStreetMap Nominatim API
- OpenWeather API
- OpenMeteo weather API
- Navigator geolocation API
- IPGeolocation astronomy API
- Axios HTTP library
- lunarphase-js library
